Payload = exploit to get a shell on victim

Non-staged:
Sends exploit shellcode all at once.
Larger in size and wont always work.
Example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

Staged:
Sends payload in stages
Can be less stable.
Example windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Note: metasploit when there is meterpreter with a / it is a staged _ is a non-staged.

There is bind and reversed staged/non-staged payload.

note: if you think the exploit is right but cant get a shell try one of 4 different payloads.
